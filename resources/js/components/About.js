                            <p>The name Bookworm was taken from the original name for New York International Airport,
                                which was renamed JFK in December 1963.</p>
                            <p>Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new location is 170 7th Avenue
                                South, at the corner of Perry Street.</p>
                            <p>From March 2008 through May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.</p>

                            <p>One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of
                                guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveller and budget.</p>
                            <p>We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook,
                                and our well-read, well-travelled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any
                                traveller, book lover, or gift giver.</p>
